This is a collection of Playbooks.

Leverage Git Submodules wherever sensible.

Once the TLD gets crowded it may be desirable to create a 'playbooks/' and in site.yaml
do a 'import_playbook playbooks/XYZ.yaml'. However if you then invoke Ansible with
'... playbook/XYZ.yaml' the location of 'group_vars' and indeed *all* of the customary
directories are now under "$playbook_dir"!  (see https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/12862)

Therefore modify ROLES_PATH to include '.' or `dirname $playbook_dir`. The same holds for
roles maintained out of tree and when leveraging submodules is not appropriate.

    env ANSIBLE_ROLES_PATH=/path1:/path2

  or as a directive in ansible.cfg

    [defaults]
    roles_path = path1:path2

Multi-stage environments should follow this design pattern.

NOTES
* 'group|host_vars' directories are relative to inventory file and $playbook_dir.

* playbook_dir/*_vars will override inventory (ass-backwards, I know)

* VAR files are evaluated in alphabetical order with last win during key merge.
  You can enforce immediate scope VAR evaluation order with numeric prefixes.
	00_loser ... 99_winner

  Separately within the constructs of parent/child relationships, variables read
  at the same tier can be influenced via 'ansible_group_priority' with highest wins.

  Carefully study https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_variables.html

* Unravel dependency chain between hosts, groups, and group-of-groups by splitting
  inventory/hosts into separate files being mindful of alphabetical order.
