This is a collection of in-house Roles. A purist might insist that they each belong
in their own respective repository (nee Chef cookbooks), but that may be impractical.

Access them from Playbooks (NOT stored in-tree) by adding this TLD to the Roles path:

	env ANSIBLE_ROLES_PATH=/some/path:/another/path
    or
	[defaults]
	roles_path = path1:path2

The implicit "$playbook_dir/roles" will still be searched, regardless.
